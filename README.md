# Endless Sky language support in Atom

##### Release 0.0.1 DOES NOT WORK

Endless Sky's language is used to mod the game.
You can add new ships, missions, outfit and so on

The language is really similar to YAML. So I fork the its language support plugin for Atom with the intention to adapt it to it.
